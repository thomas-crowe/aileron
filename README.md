This is a repository for me to keep up with things that I am working on related to Novello and OSP in general.  I will be keeping everything organized into TLD from here.  Currently there is;

* ops - This is for operations guides, job-aids, notes, etc related to the day to day activities for OSP
* post-install - This directory contains the Ansible playbook, and sample definition file for automating the post-installation configuration of a Novello stack.
* python - This directory contains very badly written python scripts that I am working on
